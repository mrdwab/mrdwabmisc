\alias{stringseed.sampling}
\title{Use any alphanumeric input as a seed}
\usage{
stringseed.sampling(seedbase, N, n, write.output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seedbase}{A vector of seeds to be used for sampling.}

\item{N}{The "population" from which to draw the sample.}

\item{n}{The desired number of samples.}

\item{write.output}{Logical. Should the output be written to a file?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, a csv file is written with the
sample "metadata", and a plain text file is written with the details of the
resulting sample. The names of the files written are \code{"Sample frame
generated on {date the script was run} .csv"} and \code{"Samples generated
on {date the script was run} .txt"} and will be found in your current
working directory.}
}
\value{
This function returns a list with the \code{class}
"stringSeedSampling" and uses a custom \code{print} method. The list items
are: \itemize{ \item \code{input}: The "metadata" to remind you of your
input parameters.  \item \code{samples}: The samples resulting from the
specified input parameters. In the case of batch sampling being used,
\code{samples} will be a named list. } Use
\code{print.default(your-object-here)} to view the underlying list.
}
\description{
The \code{\link{stringseed.sampling}} function is designed as a batch
sampling function that allows the user to specify any alphanumeric input as
the seed \emph{per sample in the batch}.
}
\examples{
# We'll use a data.frame with a list of village names, the population,
#   and the desired samples as our columns. The function will use the
#   village names to generate a unique seed for each village before
#   drawing the sample.
myListOfPlaces <- data.frame(
villageName = c("Melakkal", "Sholavandan", "T. Malaipatti"),
population = c(120, 130, 140),
requiredSample = c(30, 25, 12))
myListOfPlaces

stringseed.sampling(seedbase = myListOfPlaces$villageName,
               N = myListOfPlaces$population,
               n = myListOfPlaces$requiredSample)

# Manual verification of the samples generated for Melakkal village
#   (for which the automatically generated seed was 1331891848)
set.seed(1331891848)
sample(120, 30)

# What about using the function on a single input?
stringseed.sampling("Santa Barbara", 1920, 100)
