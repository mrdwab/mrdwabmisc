\title{Draw a random sample that sums to a specified amount}
\usage{
SampleToSum(Target = 100, VecLen = 10, InRange = 1:100, Tolerance = 2,
  writeProgress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Target}{The desired sum of all the samples}

\item{VecLen}{How many numbers should be in your resulting vector?}

\item{InRange}{What is the acceptable range of values to be sampled from?}

\item{Tolerance}{What is the maximum difference allowed between the target
and the sum? Set to "0" to match the target exactly. In general, the
difference is within 5 anyway, which is reasonable.}

\item{writeProgress}{If you want a log-file to be written that includes
\emph{all} the variations tried before arriving at a vector that satisfies
all the user's conditions, specify the output file name (quoted) with this
argument. Note that in some cases, this might be quite a large file with
tens-of-thousands of lines!}

\description{
This function creates a random sample of numbers drawn from a specified
range which sum to a specified amount.
}
\note{
This function can be notoriously slow, particularly if your range is
too narrow and your tolerance is too high.
