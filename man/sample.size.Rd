\title{Determine the optimal sample size of a given population}
\usage{
sample.size(population, samp.size = NULL, c.lev = 95, c.int = NULL,
  what = "sample", distribution = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{The population size for which a sample size needs to be
calculated.}

\item{samp.size}{The sample size. This argument is only used when
calculating the confidence interval, and defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{c.lev}{The desired confidence level. Defaults to a reasonable 95\%.}

\item{c.int}{The confidence interval. This argument is only used when
calculating the sample size. If not specified when calculating the sample
size, defaults to 5\% and a message is provided indicating this; this is
also the default action if \code{c.int = NULL}.}

\item{what}{Should the function calculate the desired sample size or the
confidence interval? Accepted values are \code{"sample"} and
\code{"confidence"} (quoted), and defaults to \code{"sample"}.}

\item{distribution}{Response distribution. Defaults to 50\%
(\code{distribution = 50}), which will give you the largest sample size.}
}
\description{
The sample.size function either calculates the optimum survey sample size
when provided with a population size, or the confidence interval of using a
certain sample size with a given population. It can be used to generate
tables (data.frames) of different combinations of inputs of the following
arguments, which can be useful for showing the effect of each of these in
sample size calculation.
}
\note{
From a teaching perspective, the function can be used to easily make
tables which demonstrate how the sample size or confidence interval change
when different inputs change. See the "Advanced Usage" examples. The
following formulae were used in this function:

\deqn{\large ss = \frac{-Z^2\times p\times(1-p)}{c^2}}{% ss = (-Z^2 * p * (1
- p))/(c^2)}

\deqn{\large pss = \frac{ss}{1+\frac{ss-1}{pop}}}{% pss = ss/(1 + ((ss -
1)/pop))}
}
\examples{
# What should our sample size be for a population of 300?
# All defaults accepted.
sample.size(population = 300)

# What sample should we take for a population of 300
#   at a confidence level of 97\%?
sample.size(population = 300, c.lev = 97)

# What about if we change our confidence interval?
sample.size(population = 300, c.int = 2.5, what = "sample")

# What about if we want to determine the confidence interval
#   of a sample of 140 from a population of 300? A confidence
#   level of 95\% is assumed.
sample.size(population = 300, samp.size = 140, what = "confidence")

## =========== ADVANCED USAGE ============== ##

# What should the sample be for populations of 300 to 500 by 50?
sample.size(population=c(300, 350, 400, 450, 500))

# How does varying confidence levels or confidence intervals
#   affect the sample size?
sample.size(population=300,
       c.lev=rep(c(95, 96, 97, 98, 99), times = 3),
       c.int=rep(c(2.5, 5, 10), each=5))

# What is are the confidence intervals for a sample of
#   150, 160, and 170 from a population of 300?
sample.size(population=300,
       samp.size = c(150, 160, 170),
       what = "confidence")
