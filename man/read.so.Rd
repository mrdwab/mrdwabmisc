\alias{read.so}
\title{Read displayed text at Stack Overflow}
\usage{
read.so(sep = "", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, out = "mydf")
}
\arguments{
\item{sep}{Most of the time, the code shared is space separated (which is
the default for this function). If the separator is any other character, it
can be specified here.}

\item{header}{Are headers included?}

\item{stringsAsFactors}{Should strings be treated as \code{factor}s.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{out}{Desired output object name. Defaults to \code{mydf}.}
}
\description{
For many questions at Stack Overflow, the question asker does not properly
share their question (for example, using \code{\link{dput}} or by sharing
some commands to make up the data). Most of the time, you can just copy and
paste the text into R using \code{read.table(text = "clipboard", header =
TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)}.  This function is basically a convenience
function for the above.
}
\details{
The output of \code{\link{read.so}} is automatically assigned to an object
in your workspace called "\code{mydf}" unless specified using the \code{out}
argument.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## Copy the following text (select and ctrl-c)

# A B
# 1 2
# 3 4
# 5 6

## Now, just type:

read.so()
}
