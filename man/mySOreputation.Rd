\title{Parse your reputation page from any of the Stack Exchange sites}
\usage{
mySOreputation(rep_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep_file}{The path to a text version of your reputation page. Windows
and Linux users can copy the text on the page with select all + copy, and
simply use "clipboard" instead of saving the contents to a local file.}
}
\description{
It is very easy to \emph{view} a detailed account of your reputation at any
of the Stack Exchange sites by visiting \code{http://"sitename"/reputation}
(obviously substituting "sitename" for the actual site of interest, for
example, \url{http://stackoverflow.com/reputation}).  However, that format
is not very user-friendly if you want to do any analysis with it. This
function parses that page into an R \code{data.frame}.
}
\examples{
## This is a real reputation file,
##    but the "question_id" variable is
##    made up.
rep_file <- system.file("soreputation.txt", package = "mrdwabmisc")
readLines(rep_file, 15)
mydf <- mySOreputation(rep_file = rep_file)
head(mydf, 15)
str(mydf)
plot(mydf$date, cumsum(mydf$rep_change))

\dontrun{
library(xts)
mydfx <- xts(mydf$rep_change, mydf$date)
apply.monthly(mydfx, sum)
plot(apply.monthly(mydfx, sum))
}

\dontshow{
rm(mydf, mydfx, rep_file)
}

\references{
Values for the "actions" variable determined after visiting
\url{http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/43004/how-do-i-audit-my-reputation/43005#43005}.
There is one value not mentioned at that page, coded as \code{action_id ==
99} and \code{action == Bonus} that corresponds to the bonus that a user
gets when they have above a certain reputation and are active on multiple
Stack Exchange sites.
