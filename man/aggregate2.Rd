\title{Perform multiple aggregation functions on grouped data}
\usage{
aggregate2(data, aggs, ids, funs = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your \code{data.frame}}

\item{aggs}{The variables that need to be aggregated, specified as a
character vector.}

\item{ids}{The variables that serve as grouping variables, specified as a
character vector.}

\item{funs}{The functions that you want to apply, specified as a character
vector.}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments to \code{aggregate}.  Really only useful for
the \code{subset} argument.}
}
\description{
Base R's \code{\link{aggregate}} function allows you to specify multiple
functions when aggregating. However, the output of such commands is a
\code{data.frame} where the aggregated "columns" are actually matrices.
\code{\link{aggregate2}} is a basic wrapper around \code{aggregate} that
outputs a regular \code{data.frame} instead.
}
\note{
This function essentially constructs a \code{formula} that can be used
with \code{aggregate} and keeps track of the names of the aggregation
functions you have applied to create new variable names. This function is
not very useful when the output of \code{FUN} would already output a matrix
(for example, if \code{FUN = fivenum} or \code{FUN = summary}). In such
cases, it is recommended to use base R's \code{aggregate} with a
\code{do.call}.  For example: \code{do.call("data.frame", aggregate(. ~
Species, iris, summary))}.

# One-to-one, two functions
(temp1a <- aggregate(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts,
            function(x) cbind(mean(x), sum(x))))

(temp1b <- aggregate2(chickwts, "weight", "feed", c("mean", "sum")))

# Many-to-many, two functions
(temp2a <- aggregate(cbind(ncases, ncontrols) ~ alcgp + tobgp, data = esoph,
            function(x) cbind(sum(x), mean(x))))
