\title{Round Numbers the Way You Learned in School}
\usage{
round2(x, digits = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The number (or vector of numbers) that needs rounding.}

\item{digits}{The number of decimal places in the output.}
}
\description{
The \code{\link{round2}} function rounds numbers in the way you probably
learned in school, that is, round up to the next number for values of 5 and
above.
}
\details{
To reduce bias in rounding, R's \code{\link{round}} function uses a
"round-to-even" approach. Still, many people are surprised when they find
that R's \code{round} function will return the same value for
\code{round(1.5)} and \code{round(2.5)}. This function uses the rounding
approach found in most school lessons and in software like Excel to make the
results comparable.

input <- seq(from = 0.5, by = 1, length.out = 10)
