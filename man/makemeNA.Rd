\title{Make certain values in a \code{data.frame} \code{NA}}
\usage{
makemeNA(mydf, NAStrings, fixed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydf}{A \code{data.frame} in which some values need to be converted to
\code{NA}}

\item{NAStrings}{The values which have been used to represent \code{NA}}

\item{fixed}{Logical. Is the \code{NAStrings} argument a fixed character (or
vector of characters) or a regular expression? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Sometimes, after having read in data, one needs to replace certain values by
\code{\link{NA}}. One approach is to use \code{mydf[mydf ==
"some-character"] <- NA}.  However, in many cases that results in a
\code{data.frame} where variables which should be numeric end up as
characters or factors if the NA string was a character to begin with. This
function is a convenience wrapper around \code{\link{type.convert}} to
address such problems.

\examples{
# Some sample data
temp <- data.frame(
V1 = c(1:3),
V2 = c(1, "*", 3),
V3 = c("a", "*", "c"),
V4 = c(".", "*", "3"))
temp
str(temp)

temp1 <- makemeNA(temp, c("*", "."))
temp1
str(temp1)

# Can make anything NA. Useful for -999 type of NA values
makemeNA(temp, "1")
\dontshow{rm(temp, temp1)}
