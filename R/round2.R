#' Round Numbers the Way You Learned in School
#' 
#' The \code{\link{round2}} function rounds numbers in the way you probably
#' learned in school, that is, round up to the next number for values of 5 and
#' above.
#' 
#' To reduce bias in rounding, R's \code{\link{round}} function uses a
#' "round-to-even" approach. Still, many people are surprised when they find
#' that R's \code{round} function will return the same value for
#' \code{round(1.5)} and \code{round(2.5)}. This function uses the rounding
#' approach found in most school lessons and in software like Excel to make the
#' results comparable.
#' 
#' @param x The number (or vector of numbers) that needs rounding.
#' @param digits The number of decimal places in the output.
