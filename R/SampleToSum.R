#' Draw a Random Sample that Sums to a Specified Amount
#' 
#' This function creates a random sample of numbers drawn from a specified
#' range which sum to a specified amount.
#' 
#' 
#' @param Target The desired sum of all the samples
#' @param VecLen How many numbers should be in your resulting vector?
#' @param InRange What is the acceptable range of values to be sampled from?
#' @param Tolerance What is the maximum difference allowed between the target
#' and the sum? Set to "0" to match the target exactly. In general, the
#' difference is within 5 anyway, which is reasonable.
#' @param writeProgress If you want a log-file to be written that includes
#' \emph{all} the variations tried before arriving at a vector that satisfies
#' all the user's conditions, specify the output file name (quoted) with this
#' argument. Note that in some cases, this might be quite a large file with
#' tens-of-thousands of lines!
#' @note This function can be notoriously slow, particularly if your range is
#' too narrow and your tolerance is too high.
